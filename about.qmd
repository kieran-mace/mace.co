Hey there,

I hope that this site serves as a resource for data scientists around the world.
Hopefully you will find some of this information useful.
Most code will be in R, but I'm beginging to learn TensorFlow and SciKitLearn which is going to be awesome!
I am a graduate student at UCSF doing high-throughput bioinformatics, with a concentration in Systems Biology and complex biologcal system.
After I graduate I hope to apply my skills in data analysis to hard problems in Data Science.
